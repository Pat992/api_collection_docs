  <h1>Postman Collections</h1>
</div>

This repository contains the generated Postman collections for my <a href="https://rapidapi.com/user/Pat92" target="_blank">APIs</a> published on RapidAPI. Each folder corresponds to a different API.

### How to use a collection
1. Subscribe to the API you want to use.
2. Open Postman and click **Import**.
3. Choose one of the following methods:
   - Paste the collection URL directly.
   - Open the URL in your browser, right-click the page, save it as a JSON file, then import that file into Postman.
4. After importing, open the collection’s **Variables** tab and replace the `x-rapidapi-key` with your own credentials.

Once your variables are set, you can start exploring the endpoints and testing requests directly from Postman.
